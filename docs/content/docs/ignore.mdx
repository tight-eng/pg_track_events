title: Ignore Tables and Columns
description: Choose which tables and columns to track
---

Changes to specific tables or columns can be ignored by including them in the `ignore` section of the `pg_track_events.config.yaml` file.

- A `*` will ignore the entire table
- An array of specific columns will ignore only those columns. 

```yaml
track: 
    ...
destinations:
    ...
ignore:
  sessions: *
  orders: ['address', 'city', 'state']
```

## Migrating the triggers 
Changes to the ignored tables or columns will not be reflected in the database until the triggers are updated. The `apply-triggers` command will stage a migration to update the triggers, and help you apply it directly to the connected database if you choose. 
```bash
`pg_track_events apply-triggers
```

## FAQ: New tables are not being tracked

If you've recently added a new table to your database, are not recieving any events from it, and don't see it in the list of ignored tables -- just run `apply-triggers`. You'll be prompted to start tracking new tables, and apply a migration including new triggers to your database. 

```bash
`pg_track_events apply-triggers
```
