description: "Send tracked database events to Amplitude for analytics"

## Configuration

To configure Amplitude as a destination for your tracked events, add the following to your `pg_track_events.config.yaml` file:

```yaml
destinations:
  amplitude:
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" # or use an environment variable (see below)
```

### Configuration Options

- `filter`: Event name glob filter (optional) [Learn about filtering events](/docs/destinations#destination-event-name-filters)
- `apiKey`: Your Amplitude API key (required). Can be hardcoded directly in the YAML or [reference an environment variable](/docs/destinations#referencing-environment-variables).
- `endpoint`: (optional) Custom API endpoint URL for Amplitude. Defaults to `https://api2.amplitude.com`.

## Getting Your Amplitude API Key

To find your API key:

1. Log in to your Amplitude account
2. Go to Settings > Projects
3. Select the project you want to use
4. Copy your API Key from the project settings

## User IDs (Distinct IDs)

The system automatically extracts a user ID from your event properties in the following order:

1. `distinct_id` property
2. Common user ID fields (`user_id`, `userid`, `_user_id`)
3. For tables named `users`, `user`, or `_users`, it will look for an `id` field

If no ID is found, the user ID will be `null`. Note that while other APIs and pg_track_events may refer to this ID as Distinct ID, in Amplitude, this identifier is known as `user_id`.

## Event Format

Events sent to Amplitude include:
- User ID (from the distinct ID)
- Event type (from your configured event name)
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Event properties (from your configured properties)

## Note

After making configuration changes, restart the pg_track_events agent for them to take effect.
