## Configuration

### Referencing environment variables

To reference an environment variable for secrets, use the `$NAME_OF_VAR` syntax.

For example, to set the Mixpanel project token via an environment variable called `MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN`, you would use the `$` syntax below:

```yaml
destinations:
  mixpanel:
    projectToken: "$MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN"
```

### Destination event name filters

The `filter` property allows you to control which events are sent to each destination by matching against event names using glob patterns.

```yaml
destinations:
  mixpanel:
    filter: "*"          # Send all events to this destination
    projectToken: "$MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN"
  
  posthog:
    filter: "user_*"     # Send only events starting with "user_"
    apiKey: "$POSTHOG_API_KEY"
  
  amplitude:
    filter: "purchase_*" # Send only events starting with "purchase_"
    apiKey: "$AMPLITUDE_API_KEY"
```

Common glob patterns:
- `*` - Match all events
- `user_*` - Match events starting with "user_"
- `*_completed` - Match events ending with "_completed"
- `*payment*` - Match events containing "payment" anywhere in the name
