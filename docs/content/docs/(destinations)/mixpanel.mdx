## Configuration

To configure Mixpanel as a destination for your tracked events, add the following to your `pg_track_events.config.yaml` file:

```yaml
destinations:
  mixpanel:
    projectToken: "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" # or use an environment variable (see below)
```

### Configuration Options

- `filter`: Event name glob filter (optional) [Learn about filtering events](/docs/destinations#destination-event-name-filters)
- `projectToken`: Your Mixpanel project token (required). Can be hardcoded directly in the YAML or [reference an environment variable](/docs/destinations#referencing-environment-variables).
- `apiEndpoint`: (optional) Custom API endpoint URL for Mixpanel. Defaults to US cloud.
- `dataEndpoint`: (optional) Custom data endpoint URL for Mixpanel. Defaults to US cloud.

## Getting Your Mixpanel Project Token

To find your project token:

1. Log in to your Mixpanel account
2. Go to project settings: https://mixpanel.com/settings/project/
3. Look for "Access Keys" section
4. Copy your project token

## Distinct IDs

The system automatically extracts a distinct ID from your event properties for user identification in the following order:

1. `distinct_id` property
2. Common user ID fields (`user_id`, `userid`, `_user_id`)
3. For tables named `users`, `user`, or `_users`, it will look for an `id` field

If no ID is found, the distinct ID will be `null`.

## Note

After making configuration changes, restart the pg_track_events agent for them to take effect.
