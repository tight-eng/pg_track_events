description: "Send tracked database events to PostHog for analytics"

## Configuration

To configure PostHog as a destination for your tracked events, add the following to your `pg_track_events.config.yaml` file:

```yaml
destinations:
  posthog:
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" # or use an environment variable (see below)
```

### Configuration Options

- `filter`: Event name glob filter (optional) [Learn about filtering events](/docs/destinations#destination-event-name-filters)
- `apiKey`: Your PostHog project API key (required). Can be hardcoded directly in the YAML or [reference an environment variable](/docs/destinations#referencing-environment-variables).
- `endpoint`: (optional) Custom API endpoint URL for PostHog. Defaults to PostHog Cloud US.

## Getting Your PostHog API Key

To find your project API key:

1. Log in to your PostHog account
2. Go to Project Settings > Project API Keys
3. Copy your project API key (it starts with `phc_`)

## Distinct IDs

The system automatically extracts a distinct ID from your event properties for user identification in the following order:

1. `distinct_id` property
2. Common user ID fields (`user_id`, `userid`, `_user_id`)
3. For tables named `users`, `user`, or `_users`, it will look for an `id` field

If no ID is found, the distinct ID will be `null`.

<Callout title="PostHog will reject events with missing distinct IDs" type="error">
  If no distinct ID is found or is null/empty, PostHog will reject the events and they will accumulate in the outbox table in your PostgreSQL database. Make sure to always include a valid distinct ID in your event properties to ensure proper event processing when sending to PostHog.
</Callout>

## Note

After making configuration changes, restart the pg_track_events agent for them to take effect.
