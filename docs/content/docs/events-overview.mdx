## Event Types

pg_track_events works with two types of events:

### Raw DB Events

Raw DB Events are the low-level database change records captured directly from your database. These events contain:

- Event type: `insert`, `update`, or `delete`
- Table name that changed
- Timestamp when the event was logged
- Complete JSON representation of the old row (for updates and deletes)
- Complete JSON representation of the new row (for inserts and updates)

Raw DB Events are useful for:
- Data warehousing and audit logs
- Building data pipelines that need the complete raw data
- Detailed forensic analysis of database changes

### Processed Events

Processed Events are semantic, application-level events that have been transformed from Raw DB Events using your configuration rules. These events contain:

- Event name (e.g., "user_signup", "order_created")
- Customized properties extracted from the database change
- Timestamp
- Optional distinct ID for user identification

Processed Events are useful for:
- Analytics platforms that expect semantic events
- Tracking user behavior and business metrics
- Creating understandable, actionable insights

Most analytics destinations (like Mixpanel, PostHog, and Amplitude) only accept Processed Events, while data warehouse destinations (BigQuery, S3) can handle both types.
