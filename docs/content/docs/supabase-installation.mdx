## Supabase Installation
We recommend setting up pg_track_events inside a backend repository, where you already have a Supabase project connected. 

If you do not have one alreayd, add an `.env.local` file to your project with a `DATABASE_URL` variable. As we'll be modifying the database, you will want to use a connection string that authenticated the `postgres` user Supabase creates. 

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://**************************"
```

You can find your connection string by clicking "Connect" in the top of the UI. 

<Image src={supabaseImg} alt="Supabase connection string location" />

After you click "Connect", you'll be able to copy the connection string. Make sure to choose the "Session Pooler" option (the 3rd one): 

<Image src={sessionPoolerImg} alt="Supabase pooler configuration" />

```

### Setup pg_track_events

Install the CLI:

```bash
curl -sSL https://tight.sh/install | bash
```

Initialize in your backend

```bash
pg_track_events init
```

Select tables you wish to track
![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tight-eng/pg_track_events/refs/heads/main/docs/public/table-choices-with-selections.jpg?raw=true)

The CLI will output the triggers, functions and tables it plans to add.

### Configure Tracked Events

Add your own trackers and configure destinations in the `pg_track_events.config.yaml`file. 
[Full instructions here](https://tight.sh/docs/defining-events)

```yaml
track:
  user.insert:
    event: "user_signup"
    properties:
      id: "new.id"
      email: "new.email"
      name: "new.name"

  user.update:
    cond: "old.email != new.email ? events.user_changed_email : events.user_updated"
    "user_changed_email":
      id: "new.id"
      previous_email: "old.email"
      new_email: "new.email"

destinations:
  posthog:
    filter: "*"
    apiKey: "$POSTHOG_API_KEY"

ignore:
  auth_authenticator: "*" # This ignores the auth_authenticator table
  user: ["hashed_password"] # This ignores the "hased_password" column
```

### Deploy a worker

Deploy a worker to your infrastructure. The Docker container created by `init` command should be ready to build and deploy, but you can customize it if you need to. [Full docs here](https://tight.sh/docs/deploying-worker)

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t pg_track_events_agent .

# Run image (interactive mode, for testing)
# The POSTHOG_API_KEY is just an example, you'll need to pass in whatever env vars you're referencing from your pg_track_events.config.yaml file
docker run -it -e DATABASE_URL="..." -e POSTHOG_API_KEY="..." pg_track_events_agent
```

Watch the events flow!
